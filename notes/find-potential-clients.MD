# Find a potential client

## STEP 1: Find out what project

Figure out what project you would like to work on. Gather a few examples of your work and prepare a simple portfolio. This way, you will be able to show your potential client what you can do.

## STEP 2: Research potential client

Listing people you know is a good place to start but there are other sources from which to find your potential customer. Here are just a few:

- **Personal Contacts:** Your friends and family are the most likely to “purchase” something from you, even if they are not your target market. Or, maybe they don't need your product or service, but know someone who does or would be willing to tell others about it.
- **Existing customers:** If you have already completed a few contracts, call upon your existing customers to see if they need more of your product or service. Selling to an existing happy customer is easier than generating a new one..
- **Ask Referrals:** Call your friends, family, and prior customers to see if they know anyone who needs your product or service. Sweeten the deal by offering a free service.
- **Internet Research:** If you know the ideal customer or client, you can go online and search for them, and then reach out to them directly. While you can do this online for all businesses, it works particularly well for doing local searches of businesses you want to work with. Social media is another great way to connect with potential businesses you would like to work with, especially LinkedIn.
- **Social Media:** Many service-based businesses find social media one of the best places to connect and build a relationship with potential clients and customers. Do you have social media followers on Instagram,Twitter, Facebook or Linkedin? While you don't want to annoy them with constant sales messages, you can interact and converse with them, increasing their awareness of you as well as building a relationship.

## STEP 3: Make contact

Once you have a list of potential clients, it's time to reach out. Here are some ideas.

**Over The Phone:** Cold calling scares many people, but if you lead by asking what they need and then present your product or service as a solution, you will have better results. Use an easy flowing, conversational script to introduce your product or purpose for calling. Remember, telling is not selling. If you are doing all the talking, the likelihood of convincing someone they need your product or service isn't going to be high. Asking questions and presenting your product or services benefits turns the focus of the call onto them instead of you.

Close with a call-to-action, such as asking them to give you an email so you can send them a portfolio. Finally, if an individual says they are not interested, ask them if they know of someone who might be and get a referral.

**Email:** While email is not as effective as a direct conversation, it is less scary and often a great way to introduce yourself. The trick is to not simply send a "buy" email, but instead, offer something of value. Give a brief explanation of who you are **don’t forget to state the fact that this is a school project**.

**In-Person:** There are many ways to meet potential clients and customers in person. You can walk into their business or you can call and make an appointment to meet in person.

It's important to remember a few key points to effective in-person selling. Don't tell them everything all at once. Instead, **find out their wants and needs** and tailor your presentation to show how your service is the solution to their problem. Always have sales material on hand to help you in this process (such as a tablet or laptop to showcase your portfolio). Make sure and end with a call to action and a promise to follow-up.

## STEP 4: Follow up

The fortune is in the follow-up. You're going to hear “no” a lot. For some people, that “no” is firm. But for others, the “no” is only “no” for now. Many business owners hear “no” and give up. But 80% of sales are not made on the first, second, or even a third contact! It can take five or more contacts to achieve a sale. In your case, it should not be too hard to sell.
